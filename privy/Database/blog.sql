Born from the Modernism movement of the early 20th century, Modern design embraces simplicity, functionality, and a rational use of materials. This blog post delves into the essence of Modern design, highlighting its key features and how it has evolved over time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Origins of Modern Design:&#13;&#10;Modern design emerged as a response to the ornate and heavily decorated styles of the past. It sought to break free from traditional design principles and embrace a more streamlined and minimalist approach. Influenced by the technological advancements and social changes of the time, Modern design aimed to create functional and efficient spaces that reflected the spirit of the modern age.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Key Elements of Modern Design:&#13;&#10;a. Open-Floor Plan: One of the defining characteristics of Modern design is the open-floor plan. Walls are minimized or removed, creating a seamless flow between different areas of the home. This layout not only enhances the sense of space but also encourages social interaction and connectivity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;b. Large Windows and Natural Light: &#13;&#10;Modern design emphasizes the use of large windows that allow ample natural light to flood into the space. This not only creates a bright and airy atmosphere but also blurs the line between the indoors and outdoors, bringing nature closer to our daily lives.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;c. Rational Use of Materials: &#13;&#10;Modern design celebrates the beauty of materials in their purest form. From exposed concrete and steel to natural woods and glass, the materials used in Modern design are chosen for their functionality and aesthetic appeal. The focus is on showcasing the inherent qualities of each material rather than concealing them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;d. Minimalism and Simplicity: &#13;&#10;Minimalism is a core principle of Modern design. Clean lines, geometric shapes, and a lack of excessive ornamentation define the aesthetic. The mantra &#34;less is more&#34; is embraced, allowing the design to speak for itself without unnecessary embellishments.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;e. Functionality and Ergonomics: &#13;&#10;Modern design prioritizes functionality and user experience. Furniture and fixtures are designed with practicality in mind, ensuring that they serve their intended purpose efficiently. Ergonomics plays a crucial role, with comfort and usability taking precedence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Evolution of Modern Design:&#13;&#10;Over the years, Modern design has evolved and adapted to changing trends and influences. While the core principles remain intact, contemporary interpretations of Modern design have incorporated elements from other styles, resulting in hybrid designs that blend the old with the new. For example, Scandinavian Modern design combines the simplicity of Modernism with the warmth and coziness of Scandinavian interiors.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Embracing Modern Design in Your Home:&#13;&#10;a. Emphasize Openness: Create an open and airy atmosphere by removing unnecessary walls and barriers. Opt for furniture with clean lines and minimalistic designs to maintain a sense of spaciousness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;b. Maximize Natural Light: Incorporate large windows and skylights to invite natural light into your home. Use sheer curtains or blinds that allow light to filter through while maintaining privacy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;c. Choose Simple and Functional Furniture: Select furniture pieces that prioritize both style and functionality. Look for clean lines, ergonomic designs, and versatile pieces that can adapt to different needs.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;d. Experiment with Materials: Incorporate a mix of materials to add visual interest and texture to your space. Consider using natural woods, metals, glass, and concrete to create a harmonious blend of textures and finishes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;e. Add Pops of Color and Art: While Modern design often embraces a neutral color palette, don&#39;t shy away from adding pops of color through accessories, artwork, or accent furniture. These elements can inject personality and create focal points within the space.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Conclusion:&#13;&#10;Modern design continues to captivate and inspire homeowners and designers alike with its timeless appeal and emphasis on functionality. By embracing the principles of Modern design, you can create a space that not only reflects your personal style but also enhances your daily living experience. Whether you opt for a full Modern design or incorporate elements into your existing style, the beauty and functionality of Modern design are sure to leave a lasting impression.', 'design', 'modern.jpg', '0000-00-00', 'active'),

Squats are a fundamental exercise that can help you build strength, increase muscle mass, and improve flexibility in your legs, buttocks, hips, and lower back. In this post, we&#39;ll explore the various advantages of incorporating squats into your fitness routine and how they engage your core muscles for stability. Get ready to unleash the power of squats and transform your lower body!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Building Lower Body Strength:&#13;&#10;Squats are renowned for their ability to target and strengthen the muscles in your lower body. By performing squats regularly, you can develop strong and toned legs, glutes, and quadriceps. The primary muscles worked during squats include the quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and calves. This compound movement engages multiple muscle groups simultaneously, making squats an efficient exercise for building lower body strength.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Increasing Muscle Mass:&#13;&#10;In addition to building strength, squats can also help increase muscle mass in your legs and buttocks. As you perform squats with proper form and gradually increase the resistance, you create a stimulus for muscle growth. Squats activate the larger muscle groups in your lower body, promoting muscle hypertrophy and contributing to a more sculpted and defined physique.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Improving Flexibility:&#13;&#10;Squats are not only beneficial for building strength and muscle mass but also for improving flexibility in the hips and lower back. The deep squatting motion helps to stretch and mobilize the hip flexors, glutes, and lower back muscles. Over time, regular squatting can enhance your overall range of motion and flexibility in these areas, leading to improved athletic performance and reduced risk of injury.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Engaging Core Muscles for Stability:&#13;&#10;While squats primarily target the lower body, they also engage your core muscles to stabilize the body during the movement. The core muscles, including the abdominals, obliques, and lower back muscles, work synergistically to maintain proper posture and balance during squats. This activation of the core muscles not only supports your spine but also enhances overall body control and stability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Proper Squat Form:&#13;&#10;- To maximize the benefits of squats and minimize the risk of injury, it&#39;s crucial to maintain proper squat form. Here are some key tips to keep in mind:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out.&#13;&#10;Keep your chest lifted, shoulders back, and core engaged throughout the movement.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Initiate the squat by bending your knees and hips simultaneously, as if you&#39;re sitting back into an imaginary chair.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below, ensuring that your knees track in line with your toes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Push through your heels and engage your glutes to return to the starting position.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Conclusion:&#13;&#10;Squats are a versatile and effective exercise that can transform your lower body strength, increase muscle mass, improve flexibility, and engage your core muscles for stability. By incorporating squats into your fitness routine, you can reap the numerous benefits they offer and take your lower body workouts to the next level. Remember to start with proper form and gradually increase the resistance as your strength and technique improve.

Push-ups target the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core muscles, making them an essential component of any well-rounded fitness routine. In this post, we&#39;ll delve into the advantages of incorporating push-ups into your workouts, including increased upper body strength, improved endurance, and enhanced posture. Get ready to master the push-up and transform your upper body!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Strengthening the Upper Body:&#13;&#10;Push-ups are renowned for their ability to strengthen the muscles of the upper body. By performing push-ups regularly, you can develop strong and toned chest muscles, shoulders, and triceps. The primary muscles worked during push-ups include the pectoralis major (chest), deltoids (shoulders), and triceps brachii (triceps). This compound exercise engages multiple muscle groups simultaneously, making push-ups an efficient way to build upper body strength.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Enhancing Endurance:&#13;&#10;In addition to building strength, push-ups can also help improve upper body endurance. As you perform push-ups and gradually increase the number of repetitions, you challenge your muscles to sustain effort over an extended period. This endurance training can enhance your ability to perform other upper body exercises and activities that require prolonged effort, such as carrying groceries or participating in sports.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Supporting Posture Correction:&#13;&#10;Push-ups can play a vital role in improving posture by strengthening the muscles that support proper alignment. As you perform push-ups, you engage your core muscles, including the abdominals and lower back, to maintain stability and control throughout the movement. Strengthening these muscles can help correct postural imbalances and promote a more upright and aligned posture.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Variations for Progression:&#13;&#10;Push-ups offer a wide range of variations that allow for progression as your strength and technique improve. Some popular push-up variations include:&#13;&#10;Wide Grip Push-Ups: Placing your hands wider than shoulder-width apart targets the chest muscles to a greater extent.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Diamond Push-Ups: &#13;&#10;Positioning your hands close together in a diamond shape emphasizes the triceps muscles.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Decline Push-Ups: &#13;&#10;Elevating your feet on a stable surface, such as a bench, increases the difficulty and places greater emphasis on the shoulders and upper chest.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Proper Push-Up Form:&#13;&#10;To maximize the benefits of push-ups and minimize the risk of injury, it&#39;s crucial to maintain proper form. Here are some key tips to keep in mind:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides, until your chest hovers just above the ground.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;- Engage your core muscles throughout the movement and avoid sagging or arching your back.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Conclusion:&#13;&#10;Push-ups are a versatile and effective exercise that can strengthen your upper body, improve endurance, and support posture correction. By incorporating push-ups into your fitness routine and progressing through different variations, you can challenge your muscles and achieve remarkable results.

This juxtaposition highlights the nuanced nature of resistance, showcasing that strength often emerges from moments of vulnerability, and that even the most delicate elements can spark a powerful force.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Embracing the Fire Within:&#13;&#10;The artwork serves as a visual narrative, emphasizing that resistance is not about being impervious to adversity, but rather about embracing the fire within and persevering in the face of obstacles. It conveys the idea that true strength lies in acknowledging one&#39;s vulnerabilities and harnessing them as sources of empowerment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Igniting Resilience and Growth:&#13;&#10;Just as a small flame can ignite a roaring fire, the artwork symbolizes how even the smallest act of resistance can lead to a cascade of personal growth and triumph.

The umbrellas serve as symbols of financial security, resources, and opportunities that act as barriers against the adversities of life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Contrast in Fortune:&#13;&#10;In stark contrast, the second figure stands exposed to the elements, devoid of any protective cover. This representation embodies the less fortunate and economically disadvantaged individuals who lack the same access to resources and opportunities. They navigate life&#39;s challenges without the safety net that the privileged enjoy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Weathering the Storm:&#13;&#10;The rainy environment serves as a backdrop, symbolizing the obstacles and hardships faced by both individuals.

The downpour becomes a metaphor for the societal divide and the harsh realities of economic disparity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Shining a Light on Inequality:&#13;&#10;Through its evocative imagery, the artwork aims to bring attention to the profound contrast between privilege and adversity, shedding light on the struggles and challenges encountered by the economically disadvantaged.

It was still warm and the air smelled sweet with pollen. You could hear the hum of crickets. A small river flowed through that valley. We opened a rickety gate and crossed a small wooden bridge. As we walked along the narrow path that led to our house I had a clear vision of what my morning routine would be like for the next fourteen days. I had been working hard for the last few months and I felt tired. I wanted this holiday to be a mini retreat. I would wake up early each day when it was still quite cool and I would meditate for a while.

(75, 2, 'querencia', 'Makeup reco', 'Hi guys,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We all know I have a Charlotte Tilbury addiction and is it out of hand? Absolutely! But is that going to stop? No Way! After Christmas Charlotte had 40% off gift sets on her website and of course I used this as a excuse to top up my makeup collection and add some bits to it. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The first kit I picked up was The Secret To Supermodel Eyes Kit, £25.00. This kit is the perfect edition to my collection because it comes with a Mini Pillow Talk mascara in Super Black which I recently ran out of. When it comes to Pillow Talk mascara&#39;s I usually use the Dream Pop formula which is the burgundy brown shade but I needed a black mascara back in my collection. You also get a full size Brow Fix Sculpting Gel which I haven&#39;t tried before. I love using products like these in my brows because they are pretty thick so they need taming.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The second kit I picked up is something I get every year, it&#39;s the Charlotte Tilbury&#39;s Iconic Mini Lip Trio Kit, £29.00. I love collecting these trio sets every year because they are so easy to throw into your handbag so you save a little space. In this years set you get the shades Supermodel, Walk Of No Shame and Pillow Talk. I have never tried the shade Supermodel before and it is stunning! It is described as mid-toned muted nude-rose matte lipstick. Of course by now we know the shade Walk Of No Shame which is the iconic red and Pillow Talk which is a nude pink tone. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;These kit&#39;s are great gifts because you get a chance to try multiple products for a reasonable price so usually I buy them as gifts but this time I treated myself. So if you need any gift ideas head over to CharlotteTilbury.com and as always all products mentioned are linked above.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lot&#39;s of love,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Que x x ', 'shopping', 'sp2.jpg', '0000-00-00', 'active'),
(76, 2, 'querencia', 'Makeup reco part2', 'Hi guys,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you&#39;ve been reading my blog for a while now you will know I adore By Beauty Bay eyeshadow palettes! They are some of the most beautifully pigmented palettes out there that are also incredibly affordable. Honestly anytime someone asks me to recommend a brand that has really pigmented shadow 9 times out of 10 I&#39;ll say Beauty Bay. That being said today I&#39;m going to be chatting to you about the palettes I got for Christmas. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Like I said I&#39;ve been a fan of this brand for a long time and usually I get the 16 pan eyeshadow palettes from By Beauty but I don&#39;t own a lot of their bigger palettes. Luckily for me I have a parent who pays attention to the makeup I love and picked me up a few of the 42 colour palettes. The first palette I opened was the By Beauty Bay Berries 42 Colour Palette, £25.00.  This palette is every persons dream who love wearing pink, red and purple tones. In these palettes you get a mix of matte and shimmer shades and honestly playing with these shades are so fun because they blend like a dream and genuinely wear really well. The last year or 2 I have really started loving a more vibrant eyeshadow look and this palette really fills in the gaps I had in my pink shadow collection. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The second palette I got was By Beauty Bay Midnight 42 Colour Palette, £25.00.  I have a mini version of this eyeshadow palette from the collection and it is by far my favourite colour story from this collection. I was so excited to open this palette because when it comes to vibrant shadows I usually go towards the blues and purples which this palette covers every version of those shades you could ever need. I also feel like this palette is the perfect partner to the Taylor Swift Midnight&#39;s album which is perfect since that&#39;s my eras outfit for June! Every time I pay with this palette I am always so excited to see what eye look I finish with. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And lastly we have By Beauty Bay Earthy 42 Colour Palette, £25.00. When I opened this palette I was really excited because it&#39;s a gorgeous mix of warm tones,greens, golds, and browns. When you look at my palette collection overall I really don&#39;t own shades like this so I&#39;m really excited to use this palette and try out some more green / brown toned eye looks. I have already used the red and gold tones and they look stunning on the eyes. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Considering each of these palettes gives you 42 shades for £25 each, the palettes have gorgeous colour stories, are insanely pigmented and wear better then some high end brands I adore. So if you want to expand your shadow collections to more vibrant shades I really recommend checking out these palettes. As always all products mentioned are linked above.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lot’s of love&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Que x x', 'shopping', 'sp3.jpg', '0000-00-00', 'active'),
